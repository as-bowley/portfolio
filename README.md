## Description

The website is built with the React framework and using Typescript and SCSS for the code and styling respectively. The project itself wasn't too challenging and didn't present any big challenges to overcome, but was more focused on gaining familiarity with using Typescript, as this was the first project I've built with Typescript.

A couple of improvements that I would like to make are;

- More dynamic animations on the avatar in the hero section. I've animated the eyes but would like to have been able to animate the head as well. I will look into using SVG's for that in the future.
- I'd like to try the site using react-router and framer motion to try and re-create the transitions seen on [Rob Owen's](https://robbowen.digital/) personal site.
